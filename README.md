# Stroke-Prediction-With-Machine-Learning
Predictive model On Stoke Prediction in a Health-Care sector using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify the likelihood of stroke in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various health-related parameters, the model aims to assist healthcare providers in early stroke detection, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.
Introduction
Stroke is a serious medical condition that requires immediate attention. Early prediction and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages machine learning to build a model that can predict the probability of a stroke based on input features such as age, gender, hypertension, and other relevant health metrics.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and accurate model that can predict stroke risk, thereby aiding in preventive healthcare measures.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and accurate model that can predict stroke risk, thereby aiding in preventive healthcare measures.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository]. It contains the following features:

Age: Age of the patient
Hypertension: Whether the patient has hypertension (1 for Yes, 0 for No)
Heart Disease: Whether the patient has heart disease (1 for Yes, 0 for No)
Ever Married: Whether the patient has ever been married (Yes or No)
Work Type: Type of occupation (Private, Self-employed, Govt Job, etc.)
Residence Type: Urban or Rural
Average Glucose Level: Average glucose level in the blood
BMI: Body Mass Index of the patient
Smoking Status: Smoking habits of the patient (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes)
Stroke: Whether the patient had a stroke (1 for Yes, 0 for No)

Data Preprocessing
The data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables were encoded, and the dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
src/: Includes the preprocessing script and model training script.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
results/: Outputs and visualizations generated from the model.
docs/: Additional documentation and detailed explanations.
images/: Visual aids used in the project.

Modeling Approach
Multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated to determine the best model for stroke prediction, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC Curve
